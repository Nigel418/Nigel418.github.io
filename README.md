**Orochi**

The Imperial assassins of the Samurai. They roam the battlefield like ghosts, terrorizing and slaughtering those unfortunate enough to cross their path. Lightly armored and trained in the arts of stealth and deception, the Orochi dispatches enemies with a katana. Usually loyal beyond reproach, the Orochi holds the darker samurai secrets of dealing death in myriad ways, from throwing deadly knives to using a poisoned blade.
**This character is an assasin type which focuses on fast moves and feints.**

League of Legends is an isometric multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of special skills. There are 157 champions eligible to play as of November 2021. Champions gain levels by killing foes and gaining experience points (XP) during the course of a match. Items are purchased with gold, which players earn both passively and actively by destroying the opponent team's minions, champions, or defensive constructions. Items are purchased in the primary game mode, Summoner's Rift, through a shop menu that is only available to players when their champion is in the team's base. Levels and stuff do not transfer across matches.
#### Main
**Yasuo**

Yasuo is a nimble fighter who wields the air itself against his adversaries. He is an Ionian of deep resolve. He was wrongfully accused of murdering his master as a proud young man, and since he was unable to prove his innocence, he was compelled to kill his own brother in self-defense. Yasuo could not forgive himself for everything he had done, even after his master's true killer was discovered, and now wanders his nation with only the wind to guide his blade.
